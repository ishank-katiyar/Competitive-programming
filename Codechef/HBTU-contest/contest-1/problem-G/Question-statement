You are given a very big integer and you have to perform the following operation EXACTLY once on the integer.

Operation is as follow: "remove a non-empty substring of (consecutive) digits from the integer and close the gap between them".

It is allowed for resultant integer to contain leading zeros. If you removes all digits, the resultant integer is considered to be 0.

You need to calculate the sum of all possible resultant integer after performing the operation JUST ONCE. 

Since the answer can be very large, print it modulo **10 ^ 9 + 7**.


Input:
The first and only line contains a single integer N (1â‰¤ N < 10 ^ 10 ^ 5).

Output:
In the only line print the required sum modulo **10 ^ 9 + 7**.


Constraints:
 1 <= N < 10 ^ 10 ^ 5;


Subtasks:
 subtask 1 (10 points): 1 <= N < 10 ^ 18
 subtask 2 (20 points): 1 <= N < 10 ^ 100
 subtask 3 (70 points): original constraints
 

Examples


input 1:
107
output 1:
42


input 2:
100500100500
output 2:
428101984


sample Explanation:

Consider the first example.

if you can choose to remove 1, 0, 7, 10, 07, or 107. The resultant integer are 07, 17, 10, 7, 1, 0. Their sum is 42.


You need to print the sum with modulo **10 ^ 9 + 7**.
