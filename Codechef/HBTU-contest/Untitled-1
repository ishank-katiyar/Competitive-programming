We have an array A consisting of integers of length n. We have constructed another array B of length n such that Bi=Ai ^ n where ‘^’ is XOR operation. This array B is known to you in input. Now you are given an integer k and your task is to calculate XOR of each element of array A with k. (Ai ^ k)

We have a list of N players  and we want to form a team. We have their batting skills stored in an array A and bowling strengths stored in another array B. We are also given a binary string X having Xi=1 if the given if the player has wicketkeeping skills as well. Now we want to form a team such that  sum of batting skills of all the players is at least x and sum of bowling skills of the team is at least y and has at least 1 wicketkeeper in the team. We want to know if it possible to form a team if yes print a suitable team else -1.
input:
n <= 15
We can find all the subsets of size 11 and  and check if it fulfills all the conditions. Time complexity of this implementation must be O((2^N)*N).
I can't really come up with some greedy solution to it.

You are given a matrix with 0s and 1s , cells containing 1 can form a path with other cells with 1s , if they are adjacent or diagonally connected.
We hv to find the path with max no. Of 1s and output the no. Of 1s. The path need not to be just linear and can have branches.
Actually I meant the max no. Of 1s connected to each other of all the 1s connected in the whole matrix.
By using DFS and calculating tha max no. Of cells that are connected in the whole matrix
1<=n,m<=300
Time complexity would be O(n*m)

You are given a nxm grid which contains some integer values . A grid is called good if all the integeral values in cells of grid are non - negative.
The negative elements are connected with each other if they share a common side. You can perform following operation :
1) Increase any cell value by 1 which will also increase the whole connected chain by 1.
You have to make the grid good .
Print the minimum number of operations to make the grid good.

1<=n,m<=1000;
-1000000000<=grid values<=1000000000;
We can solve this question using Grid DFS . In each DFS call we will find  the minimum element and add its absolute value in the answer .
Expected Time Complexity: O(NxM)

There are n blocks arranged in a row starting with values Ai. There is a ball placed in block 1. The task is to move the ball to the nth block. You are also given an integer K. 
Steps to move the ball :
1.	You can move the ball in only forward direction.
2.	If the ball is at index i then you can move the ball directly to any one of the index i+1, i+2, i+3………i+k.
3.	The cost of moving the ball from index i to index j is abs(Ai-Aj).
Your task is to move the ball to nth block in the minimum cost. Print the minimum cost.
n<=1000 and 1<=k<=n.

There is a grid and people are standing at different points. One person is at point 0,0 he has some money m, he has to collect a minimum of 10^6 for a donation. We have to find minimum radius r he has to cover to collect the money.
N=no. Of people other than the one at 0,0
M= money he currently have
Xi , Yi position of other people  k=money they have
**The distance will be in points
1<=N<=1000
1<=M<10^6
-10^4<=Xi,Yi<=10^4
1<=k<10^6
We just have to sort according to the distance, and find the min index at which money is atleast 10^6 and print the distance.
Greedy, sorting
O(nlogn) for sorting, O(n) to find the index

There are n workers in a factory who make hand made toys. The ith worker (1<=i<=n) makes a toy in ai seconds.
You can decide their schedule .What is the minimum time needed to make m toys.
1≤n≤200005, 1≤m≤10^9
1≤ai≤10^9
Input:
3 8
3 2 5
output :
9
Explanation :  worker 1 makes three toy, worker 2 makes four toy and worker 3 makes one toy.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N*log(10^18))
Solution: I will apply Binary search on range 1 to 10^18 and check how many toys we can make in that time.We will select the suitable minimum time.
Code :
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0), cin.tie(0), cout.tie(0);
    ll n=0,m=0,i=0,cnt=0,res=0;
    cin>>n>>m;
    vector<ll> v(n);
    for(i=0;i<n;i++){
        cin>>v[i];
    }
    ll l=0,r=LONG_LONG_MAX-5;
    res=LONG_LONG_MAX;
    while(l<=r){
        ll mid=l+(r-l)/2;
        cnt=0;
        for(i=0;i<n;i++){
            cnt+=mid/v[i];
            if(cnt>m) break;
        }
        if(cnt>=m){
            res=min(mid,res);
            r=mid-1;
        }
        else{
            l=mid+1;
        }
    }
    cout<<res<<endl;   
    return 0;
} (

You are given an integer n. Your task is to find an array A of size n in which all elements should be unique and for any tuple 1<=i,j,k<=n
Ai + Aj != Ak.
3<=n<=100

Solution :
We can modify fibonacci series such that
first print 1 2
then next element as sum of previous two +1
