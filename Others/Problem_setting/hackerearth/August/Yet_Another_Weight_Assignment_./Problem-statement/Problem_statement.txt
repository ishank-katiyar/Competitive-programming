Bob has an edge-weighted tree with N vertices.

Value of a simple path in a tree is sum of weights of its edges. Beautifullness of a tree is sum of value of all simple paths in a tree.

Bob is fond of Beautifullness of his tree, so he like it as maximum as possible.

One day while Bob was at work, Alice was playing with his tree and fliped the sign of some weights of tree.

For example, if Bob had tree with weights [1,2,3,4,5], bob could have flip sign of 2nd and 4th weight and it will become [1,-2,3,-4,5].

For every i between 0 and N - 1, help Bob to find Maximum possible Beautifullness of the tree if Alice had fliped exactly i weights of the tree. 

Note:- A simple path in a tree is a path where every vertex is distinct.
